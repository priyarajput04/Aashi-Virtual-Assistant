## Report on Virtual Assistant Implementation

### Overview
The project implements a virtual assistant named "Aashi" capable of performing various tasks like setting reminders, fetching weather updates, getting news, retrieving stock prices, making phone calls, sending text messages, defining words, and telling jokes. The assistant uses various APIs and services to perform these tasks and can respond to voice commands.

### Libraries and Packages
The implementation uses the following libraries and packages:
- `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech conversion.
- `speech_recognition`: For recognizing and processing voice commands.
- `wikipedia`: For fetching summaries from Wikipedia.
- `webbrowser`: For opening web pages.
- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `smtplib`: For sending emails.
- `time`: For time-related functions.
- `random`: For random selection, particularly for jokes.
- `threading`: For running tasks in parallel.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests to various APIs.
- `twilio`: For making phone calls and sending text messages using the Twilio API.

### Key Functions
The virtual assistant has several key functions, each responsible for a specific task:

1. **Initialization and Configuration**
   ```python
   engine = pyttsx3.init('sapi5')
   voices = engine.getProperty('voices')
   engine.setProperty('voice', voices[1].id)
   ```

2. **Text-to-Speech**
   ```python
   def speak(text):
       engine.say(text)
       engine.runAndWait()
   ```

3. **Greeting the User**
   ```python
   def wishMe():
       hour = int(datetime.datetime.now().hour)
       if 0 <= hour < 12:
           speak("Good morning!")
       elif 12 <= hour < 18:
           speak("Good afternoon!")
       else:
           speak("Good evening!")
       speak("I am Aashi. Please tell me how may I help you.")
   ```

4. **Voice Command Recognition**
   ```python
   def takeCommand():
    # code to take Command
    pass
   ```

5. **Sending Email**
   ```python
   def sendEmail(to, content):
    # code to Send Email
    pass
   ```

6. **Setting Reminders**
   ```python
   def setReminder(time, message):
    # code to set reminder
    pass
   ```

7. **Getting Weather Information**
   ```python
   def getWeather(location):
    # code to get weather
    pass
   ```

8. **Getting News**
   ```python
   def getNews():
    # code to get news
    pass
   ```

9. **Getting Stock Prices**
   ```python
   def getStockPrice(symbol):
    # code to get stock price
    pass
   ```

10. **Making Phone Calls**
    ```python
    def makePhoneCall(number):
    # code to make phone call
    pass
    ```

11. **Sending Text Messages**
    ```python
    def sendText(number, message):
    # code to send text
    pass
    ```

12. **Getting Definitions**
    ```python
    def getDefinition(word):
    # code to get definition
    pass
    ```

13. **Telling Jokes**
    ```python
    def getJoke():
    # code to get definition
    pass
    ```

### Main Loop
In the main loop, adding the functionality for writing and sending an email involves recognizing the user's command, prompting for the email details (recipient and content), and using the sendEmail function to send the email.

Hereâ€™s how to integrate the email functionality into the main loop:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    wishMe()
    while True:
        query = takeCommand()

    # Logic for executing tasks based on query
    ```
